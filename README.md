# Examples Deliverable
**Scenario:** a security-related task to be demonstrated. we extend each scenario to a full network using "Network Templates".

**Network Templates**: generic network segments used to extend each scenario.

**Variant**: A GNS3 File, Fully working network that extends a scenario with an arbitrary network.

### Goal:
To have 20 Variants in total.

Process of creating a variant:
1. Pick an exercise.
2. Plan a variant in GNS3. Use available network templates. *do not configure* devices, this will be done later by Elad and Miro.
3. Write an intent of what needs to be configured. for example: “Define Router FIREWALL to act as a firewall, Switch1 is in zone1 and Switch2 is in zone2”
4. Submit variant + intent to Rami for approval.
5. Devices configuration(done by Elad and Miro).
